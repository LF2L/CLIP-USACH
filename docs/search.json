It will be a synchronous session, so all CLT are expected to attend. In addition, a series of contents and activities are proposed to the CLT to be completed during the sprint:\n\nFirstly, you will find three conceptual videos which are proposed to open the discussion on the three thematic pillars that constitute the Climate Lab project: Climate Change, Social Innovation and Innovation Labs.\nSecondly, two case experiences from members of the consortium are shared. This way we can learn a little more about the experience of each of the CLT.\nNext, you will find the link to the team workshop of this sprint. The workshop should be completed before the end of the sprint (April 29).\nAnd finally, complementary readings are offered for those who would like to further explore the topics addressed in this sprint.\n\n\nNOTICE!\nThe full recording of the webinar can be watched below. Alternatively, you can access the slides from the webinar here."
