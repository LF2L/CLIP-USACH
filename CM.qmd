# Program Description

## Methodology 

The incubation program is structured in six sprints in which participants are introduced to a set of conceptual material together with specific strategic workshops.
The CLIP has a duration of six months starting from **XXX/2023 - XXX / 2024**. 

Each sprint has specific goals that the CLT should fulfill in order to successfully complete the program. 
The results of each sprint are to be uploaded to the website assigned to each team.
The website will serve as a prototype for the strategic design of the Innovation Labs that the CLT can ultimately use to validate their proposals with other stakeholders, and as a dissemination tool for their local Climate Lab initiative.

## The scientific baseline of this program.

The incubation program is conceived as a collective pool of knowledge and therefore brings together various methods, practices and tools shared by consortium members and invited experts. 
All the different experiences are articulated under the innovation lab framework that has been developed by the ERPI of Université de Lorraine as part of its research strand in fostering collaborative innovation processes [@Osorio2019].
:::


Building on the context analysis and capability mapping, this incubation program proposes to the CLT to proactively and collectively strategize in terms of the main innovation lab components as shown in the figure below.

## Key Action Moments 

There are five key action moments throughout the CLIP:

-   **Sprint opening** (1h30 per sprint)

    -   Synchronous webinar via Zoom in which sprint goals and main activities are presented to CLT

-   **Online material** (Between 1h and 1h30 of video content per sprint)

    -   CLT can access the online material via the CLIP website. Content is composed by conceptual videos, case experiences and complimentary readings

    -   Members of CLT should access this content prior conducting each workshop

-   **Team workshops** (Between 1h30 and 2h per workshop)

    -   Each sprint proposes to the CLT a strategic workshop that should be conducted as a team

    -   Workshops templates are provided via the Mural platform

-   **Tutorships** (1h30 per sprint)

    -   Intermediary check-ins via Zoom are proposed to the CLT in the forms of Q&A sessions

    -   This is the moment for CLT to exchange with their mentors and guest experts to share their experiences or ask questions regarding the ongoing sprint's goal.

-   **Upload and share sprint results**

    -   By the end of each sprint, the CLT should upload their workshop results to their Climate Lab website prototype

    -   At the beginning of the next sprint, the CLT will briefly present to the consortium their results and learnings


::: {.callout-warning}
**Participants from each CLT are expected to dedicate 2 hours minimum per week to the CLIP.**

## Successful completion of the program {.unnumbered}

To successfully complete the incubation program, the CLT need to: 

1.  Conduct as a team each one of the workshops that will be assigned in each sprint. 
2.  Upload the workshop results to a non-published website that will constitute the prototype for the strategic design of their ClimateLab.
3.  Share progress at the beginning of each sprint.
4.  Final presentation of the strategic design of the Climate Lab at the mid-project meeting.

## Operation and online platforms {.unnumbered}

-   All the incubation program content will be available through the **CLIP Website**: [\<https://lf2l.fr/CLIP/\>](https://lf2l.fr/CLIP/){.uri} 
-   Webinars and video calls will be held through **Zoom**.
-   Workshop templates will be available via **MURAL**.
-   Website prototype templates will be provided via **Google Sites**.
