  abstract = {This article offers support and guidance for students undertaking a literature review as part of their dissertation during an undergraduate or Masters course. A literature review is a summary of a subject field that supports the identification of specific research questions. A literature review needs to draw on and evaluate a range of different types of sources including academic and professional journal articles, books, and web-based resources. The literature search helps in the identification and location of relevant documents and other sources. Search engines can be used to search web resources and bibliographic databases. Conceptual frameworks can be a useful tool in developing an understanding of a subject area. Creating the literature review involves the stages of: scanning, making notes, structuring the literature review, writing the literature review, and building a bibliography.},

   abstract = {Innovation is a complex and multifaceted notion, sometimes difficult to explain. The category of innovation spaces includes co‐working spaces, third places, Living Labs, open labs, incubators, accelerators, hothouses, canteens, FabLabs, MakerSpaces, Tech Shops, hackerspaces, design factories, and so on. Working based on the communities' needs and motivations is a key stage in order to overcome the obstacles of collective innovation and lay favorable foundations for the emergence of shared actions that can be converted into collective innovation projects. Organizations are multiplying the opportunities of creating collective intelligence at the service of innovation. Consequently, an innovation space must favor creativity and sharing. It must also promote individual and collective learning. Collective intelligence involves the networking of multiple types of intelligence, the combination of knowledge and competences, as well as cooperation and collaboration between them.},

   abstract = {There is a strong emergence of new spaces to foster innovation all over the world (Fablabs, Living Labs and Design Factories, among others). Past experiences have shown these types of projects involving “innovation laboratories” are at risk of not succeeding in their goals. Although several studies have tackled the problem of design, development and sustainability of innovation laboratories, there is still a gap in understanding how the capabilities and performance of these environments are affected by the strategic intentions at the early stages of design and functioning. Throughout this work, eight frameworks from the literature that analyse innovation laboratories are identified and compared. Then, based on both literature and the authors’ experience, an updated framework is proposed as the basis for a guidance tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to assess or to adapt an existing project. As part of the operationalisation process of the framework, a maturity grid-based assessment tool is proposed to evaluate the maturity degree of an innovation laboratory. Afterwards, to evaluate the viability and to integrate the perception of innovation laboratory managers, an exploratory study with answers from fifteen laboratories from five different countries is performed. Insights and implications for emerging and already existent projects of innovation laboratories are then discussed.},

   abstract = {Strategic intent is a useful concept in accounting for purpose and continuity of goals in an organization adapting to internal and external developmental pressures. Yet, extant literature on strategic intent does not account for heterogeneity of goals within an organization. Indeed, there is confusion over who possesses strategic intent. In this paper, we seek to revitalize the concept of strategic intent by exploring its potential as a rhetorical device. Based on philosophical theory of collective agency, we argue that to realize the integrative promise of strategic intent in organizations, achieving coherence between multiple intents is the most viable option. Drawing from rhetorical theories, we investigate the processes involved in diffusing intent and building coherence between multiple intents. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

New perspectives in the development of museum experiences are being open which impacts the overall functioning of these institutions. To design experiences that are adapted to enhance the visitor experience appropriate methods are required. User experience design and Living labs approach offer tools to support this process. In this paper, we document the experience of the renovation of the Museum-Aquarium in interaction with the Fab Living Lab platform, the academic innovation space of Nancy, France. We present the process of the development of three interactive and digital experiences based on ideation, rapid-prototyping, and test by use. This experience presents the methods and shares the lessons learned in this process. The work performed can serve as references for the development of other museum interactive installations. Furthermore, we identify potential transfer to other domains.},

   abstract = {Since several years now, there has been a proliferation of prodigious spaces for fostering creativity and innovation. Governments, companies, universities, and communities have turned to the implementation of innovation labs as the places where innovation processes are expected to be enhanced through open and agile forms of collaboration. However, there are concerns on how the lack of a clear and shared strategic intent undermines the innovation labs' purpose and how these initiatives struggle to share and align their strategic intent with all the stakeholders. Thus, this dissertation, following an action research approach under multiple research settings, aims to explain how the strategic intent of innovation labs is built and can be used to guide their performance. Throughout this thesis, innovation labs are recognized as intermediary organizational forms created to support and facilitate the innovation intent in multi-stakeholder contexts. Moreover, it is also addressed how innovation lab settings require sensemaking and feedback processes that allow them to create and maintain a strategic alignment among their stakeholders. Accordingly, this work focuses on the design of mechanisms that enable (1) the representation of the constituent elements of the organizational strategic intent of an innovation lab, (2) understanding how this intent unfolds over time and the stages it goes through, and (3) the identification of competences and roles within innovation lab teams that help to navigate the innovation lab intent. Altogether, they constitute a methodological approach to support strategy making processes in such collaborative environments.},

We approach the topic of spatial interventions from different perspectives and shed light on crucial aspects of how innovation spaces can be used as a ‘silent coach.’ This approach takes into consid- eration the conceptual interplay of the strategic discourse, theoretical accounts of coaching practice and the process of using innovation spaces. We further introduce a framework for spatial interventions that helps to structure and analyze the use of space during a workshop. Finally, based on findings from a case study that was conducted in the newly created innovation space of a large company, we apply and expand this theoretical framework. The approaches and findings of this chapter support both strategists and practitioners and contribute to a deeper understanding of how to make use of space as a strategic tool.},

In this research and in line with authors like Yanez and Kahlil (2010) technology is considered as a complex system of knowledge and know-how supported by equipment. This includes scientific and technical knowledge as well as business abilities, these latter correspond to any knowledge mobilized for the economical exploitation of technic: supply chain management, quality management, sales and other businesses. Literature attests of some decision aided approaches proposed by authors to strengthen the elaboration of the technological strategy of companies (Cooper, 2000; Kaplan and Jarzabkowski, 2006; Kim and Mauborgne, 2010). These approaches are always evolving as the context of companies is changing. In this research, to update methodologies aiming at the identification of scenario about the company's profession and knowledge of tomorrow and the corresponding tomorrow business ecosystem of the company, the following concepts are studied and combined:-The theory of evaluation applied to the field of knowledge and know-how. Attention is directed toward the data collection and treatment approaches required considering different theoretical problems: the existence or not of standards, the influence of the evaluator on the system to be evaluated, the importance of the scale and context (does a particular knowledge have the same interest and value within a team and the related company and according to the targeted markets?). Moreover the dynamic aspect of knowledge has to be taken in account considering employees mobility and the effects of experience among others,-The concept of Value. Value creation represents an industrial key success factor (Kumar and Reinartz, 2016). Then, the definition of the concept of Value is a major concern when choosing the technology to adopt in the company, it can be considered as multi-criterial with the integration of financial, marketing, reputational, sustainable and strategic criteria (Boly, 2016). One problem is the temporal dimension: Value is unstable if considering short or long term,},

   abstract = {This paper presents an explorative study dedicated to the evaluation of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) platforms immersing different stakeholders that have to collaborate within an innovation process in the area of smart cities. A previous study has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion perceived by users/citizens in realistic environments that not only fulfil the 'realism' principle of a Living Lab but also greatly contribute to both phenomena of technology acceptance and adoption of the proposed solution. Scholars have previously identified three main factors characterizing an immersive environment: the degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement perceived by users. However, creating close to real-life simulated city environments that provide an appropriate degree of immersiveness, presence and engagement for potential users in the context of urban projects remains a challenge. The traditional working habits of smart cities stakeholders, such as: territorial engineers, town-planners and policy makers, are not prepared for behaving properly in immersive environments. Several experiments were carried out during different events that provided both quantitative and qualitative data through the use of surveys, interviews and observations. For each experiment several VR/AR equipment were used. The findings highlight the complementarity between physical and digital technologies supporting co-creation for smart city projects, and the advantage of enabling experts in a field to discover new technologies. Finally, this study provides valuable elements on how to better support close to real-life simulated city environments while providing a higher level of stakeholders' engagement during the ideation of the co-creation stage of the innovation process towards the realization of smart-cities.},

   abstract = {En juin 2014, la première plate-forme Fab Living Lab de Lorraine était inaugurée. Plate-forme d'évaluation prospective des usages au service de l'innovation, le Lorraine Fab Living Lab® (LF2L) permet de co-créer, prototyper et tester des produits et services rêvés par des citoyens et des entreprises soucieux de participer ensemble à l'amélioration des territoires créatifs de demain. Nous reviendrons sur la genèse de ce dispositif scientifique et technique capable d’accélérer le passage de l’idée ou concept abstrait (2D) à leur matérialisation (3D virtuelle ou prototypée) en les évaluant (4D – scénarios d’évolution). Nous établirons le lien entre les technologies qu’il rassemble et l'écosystème qu'il génère: ingénierie collaborative, implication des usagers, matérialisation des idées, évaluation par l’usage et de la capacité à innover, et enfin son dispositif mobile associé, le Nomad'Lab, qui permet de se rendre au plus près des entreprises. Pour finir, nous mettrons en perspective ses activités au regard des innovations sociétales dans lesquelles elles s’inscrivent : support aux projets scientifiques, accompagnement des entreprises en phase amont de leurs projets d’innovation, soutien à la co-conception des projets urbains, mise à disposition du LF2L à la communauté des makers, etc.},

   abstract = {Regarding SMEs' relationship with R&D and technology, university technology transfer (UTT) programs have evolved in recent years toward approaches that are more focused on a systemic and continuous exchange between firms, university departments, and R&D centers. Financial support such as innovation vouchers and open initiatives has been applied for a few years, and only recently have research works analyzed the impacts of these programs on the innovative capabilities of SMEs. Existing studies are based on short-term analysis, but there are no studies on the medium-or long-term influence of innovation vouchers on firms' innovation capabilities. This chapter aims to contribute to this topic through a longitudinal exploratory study of two SMEs in eastern France. It puts forward an original modular program proposed by an engineering school at the University of Lorraine, where groups of students participate throughout the academic year in innovation-related projects. Empirical evidence shows that this type of project has positive impacts on firms' innovative capabilities, but also fosters the analytical skills and self-directed learning capabilities of students.},

   abstract = {Public and private organizations are turning to innovation labs as open spaces that provide a stimulating and collaborative environment for developing new solutions. However, sustaining an innovation lab is a challenging task that requires more than well-meant intentions. Although this issue has been of interest to scholars for some time now, little is known about how innovation labs are managed or the main factors influencing their adaptation and evolution. Building on an existing framework, this article focuses on a case study of the ViveLab Bogotá, an innovation lab in the Colombian public sector. The results reveal that having a clear and shared strategic intent, effective governance mechanisms, a defined financial model, continuous knowledge generation and a community-based approach, are factors that may enable or limit an innovation lab to experience a sustainable evolution. Finally, reflections are also shared on the use of the selected framework and possible points for improvement.},

@article{Enjolras2023,
   abstract = {Group decision‐making (GDM) problems usually include stakeholders with different views and opinions. In order to find a collective solution, it is necessary to achieve a consensus reaching process (CRP) that may lead to the emergence of non‐cooperative behaviors within the group. This article proposes to study how these non‐cooperative behaviors appear in a group of decision‐makers and what their level of impact is on the evolution of consensus and on the final decision. To provide some answers to this research problem, we propose a multi‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) methodology implementing analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in order to provide a visualization of the CRP evolution and observe four non‐cooperative behaviors within small‐scale GDM: (1) collective agreement, (2) blocking behavior, (3) leadership demonstration, and (4) experts' coalition. We implement our methodology within a pedagogical framework, in 29 small‐scale groups of masters and engineering students, through a case study related to the implementation of forest management scenarios in France. Our results show the evolution of the four non‐cooperative behaviors within the groups, as well as their impact on the CRP outcomes.},

@article{Rayna2019,
   abstract = {The aim of this research is to explore the dynamics and impact of open social innovation, within the context of fab labs and makerspaces. Using an exploratory methodology based on 12 semi-structured interviews of fab lab founders belonging to The Centres for Maker Innovation and Technology (CMIT) programme – a network of 170 fab labs located in Eastern Europe – this research explores the impact of an adopting an open approach in relation to the different stages of social innovation (prompts, proposals, prototypes, sustaining, scaling and diffusion, systemic change) as well as social impact. The main results of this study are that while the CMIT programme provided each fab lab with similar initial conditions (identical funding, objectives and rules), the open social innovation approached adopted enabled to give birth to a wide diversity of fab labs, each being very well adapted to the local environment, social needs and constraints and able to deliver social impact in just a matter of years; a result that would be hard to achieve with a centralised top-down approach. The study identified three types of CMITs – Education, Industry and Residential – which could be similar or different depending on the stage of social open innovation. Furthermore, this paper discusses the main difficulties social entrepreneurs encounter as a part of the open social innovation process, as well as means to overcome them. In this respect, this study adds to the literature on fab labs by providing more comprehensive view of the challenges faced by fab labs (and makerspaces) founders, as well as suggestions of strategies enabling to ensure their long-term sustainability.},
